# THOUGHTS

uhhhh opengl maybe?....kinda wanna do 3d maps but doing 2d to save time would absolutely be fine.

if we do 3d maps we'd need a debug mode thingy and a thing to move the player sprite n' shit to the right spawn position if we do 2d it'd be easier since we're locked to x and y axis instead of x y and z

i feel like the best thing to get done first is 3d model loading & map stuff

THEN basic movement with a placeholder sprite
